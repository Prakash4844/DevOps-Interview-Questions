    WIP limits in Kanban restrict the number of items in progress at any given time. They help optimize flow, reduce multitasking, and highlight bottlenecks in the workflow.

16. **How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within an Agile team, especially during sprint planning or retrospective meetings?**

    Conflicts are addressed openly and collaboratively, with a focus on the team's shared goals. Techniques like active listening, compromise, and facilitation can be used to resolve conflicts constructively.

17. **What is Test-Driven Development (TDD), and how does it fit into Agile development practices?**

    TDD is a development approach where tests are written before writing code. It fits into Agile by ensuring that code is testable, driving design decisions, and providing rapid feedback.

18. **How do you measure the success of an Agile project? What key metrics or KPIs do you track?**

    Success is measured through key performance indicators (KPIs) such as velocity, sprint burndown, customer satisfaction, and cycle time. The ultimate measure is delivering value to the customer.

19. **What do you think are the most important qualities or skills for an Agile developer or team member to possess?**

    The most important qualities include adaptability, collaboration, communication, problem-solving, and a focus on delivering value to the customer.

20. **How do you ensure that Agile principles are embraced not only by the development team but also by stakeholders and the organization as a whole?**
