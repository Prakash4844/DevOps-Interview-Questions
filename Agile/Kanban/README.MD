**Kanban:**

1. **What is Kanban, and how does it differ from Scrum?**
   
   Kanban is an Agile methodology that focuses on visualizing and optimizing workflow. Unlike Scrum, which works in fixed time frames (sprints), Kanban allows work to flow continuously, adapting to changes as they occur.

2. **Explain the core principles of Kanban.**

   The core principles of Kanban include visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress (WIP), making process policies explicit, managing flow, and improving collaboratively. 

3. **What are WIP limits in Kanban, and why are they important?**

   WIP limits are constraints on the number of items that can be in progress at any given time. They are crucial in Kanban because they help prevent overloading the team, reduce multitasking, and maintain a smooth workflow.

4. **How does Kanban help manage and optimize workflow?**

   Kanban visualizes the entire workflow, making it easier to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. By setting WIP limits and focusing on flow, teams can continuously optimize their processes.

5. **What is a Kanban board, and what information does it typically display?**

   A Kanban board is a visual representation of the workflow. It typically displays columns representing different stages of work (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done") and cards representing work items. The board provides real-time visibility into the status of each item.

6. **Describe the concept of "pull" in Kanban. How does it impact work progression?**

   In Kanban, work is pulled into the next stage of the workflow when there is capacity, rather than being pushed in. This ensures that work progresses smoothly, and teams only start new work when they have the capacity to do so.

7. **How does Kanban handle changes in priorities or new work items that need to be added to the backlog?**

   Kanban allows for flexibility in handling changes. New work items can be added to the backlog, and the team can reprioritize them as needed. The team can also pull in urgent items while maintaining WIP limits.

8. **What are the key metrics used in Kanban to measure and improve workflow efficiency?**

   Key metrics in Kanban include lead time (the time it takes for a work item to move from start to finish), cycle time (the time a work item spends in active development), and throughput (the number of items completed over time). These metrics help teams identify areas for improvement.

9. **Can you explain the difference between a Kanban system and a Kanban board?**

   A Kanban system encompasses the entire workflow management approach, including principles, policies, and practices. A Kanban board is a specific tool used to visualize and manage that workflow, typically displayed on a physical or digital board.
