**Scrum:**

1. **What is Scrum, and what are its core principles and values?**

   Scrum is an Agile framework that emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Its core principles include empirical process control, self-organizing teams, and delivering value incrementally.

2. **Explain the roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team in Scrum.**

   - Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and serves the team.
   - Product Owner: Represents the customer, defines priorities, and ensures the team builds the right product.
   - Development Team: Self-organizing group responsible for delivering the product.

3. **What is a Sprint in Scrum, and how long should it ideally last?**

   A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration in Scrum, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. It results in a potentially shippable product increment.

4. **What is a Product Backlog, and how does it evolve during a Scrum project?**

   The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features and requirements. It evolves throughout the project as new items are added, refined, or reprioritized based on feedback and changing business needs.

5. **Describe the purpose and benefits of Scrum ceremonies, such as sprint planning, daily stand-up, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.**

   - Sprint Planning: Sets the goals and plans the work for the upcoming sprint.
   - Daily Stand-up: Provides a brief daily update on progress and identifies impediments.
   - Sprint Review: Demonstrates completed work to stakeholders and collects feedback.
   - Sprint Retrospective: Reflects on the sprint, identifies improvements, and plans for the next sprint.

6. **How does Scrum handle changes in requirements or scope during a project?**

   Changes are captured in the Product Backlog and can be addressed in future sprints. Scrum allows for flexibility in adapting to changing customer needs.

7. **What is the Definition of Done (DoD) in Scrum, and why is it important?**

   The Definition of Done defines the criteria that a work item must meet to be considered complete. It ensures a shared understanding of quality and helps prevent incomplete work.

8. **What is the role of the Scrum Master in ensuring the Scrum process is followed and impediments are resolved?**

   The Scrum Master serves as a coach and facilitator, ensuring the team follows Scrum practices, removing impediments, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

9. **Can you explain the concept of "velocity" in Scrum, and how is it used for planning and forecasting?**

   Velocity is a measure of a team's capacity and is used to plan and forecast how much work can be completed in future sprints. It's calculated based on the team's historical performance.
