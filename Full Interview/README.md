# Site Reliability Engineer Interview Questions

## Infrastructure and Reliability

1. How would you design a highly available infrastructure for a cloud-based application? What components and strategies would you implement?

Ans: 1. Multi-AZ and Multi-Region Setup (AWS):

    Multi-AZ: Distribute resources like EC2, RDS, and ECS tasks across multiple Availability Zones to survive zone failures.

    Multi-Region (if needed): Use Route 53 with latency-based routing and global databases (like Aurora Global) for region-level failover.

    2. Load Balancing:

    Use AWS ALB for distributing traffic across healthy ECS services. Enable health checks to detect and reroute around failed instances.

    3. Auto Scaling:

    Implement auto-scaling groups for ECS (Fargate or EC2) based on CPU/memory metrics to handle variable loads without downtime.

    4. Stateless Microservices with ECS/EKS:

    Run application services in containers using ECS. Keep them stateless and store sessions in Redis (Elasticache) or DynamoDB.

    5. Database High Availability:

    Use RDS with Multi-AZ for transactional workloads.

    Read replicas for scaling reads.

    For analytics: use Snowflake or Redshift with separate clusters and failover strategies.

    6. Caching Layer:

    Use Elasticache (Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times, with replication and failover enabled.

    7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

    Provision all resources with Terraform, enabling consistent, versioned infra deployments across environments.

    8. CI/CD & Automation:

    Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring safe rollouts and rollbacks.

    9. Monitoring & Alerting:

    Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection and New Relic for APM. Set up alerts on SLOs (latency, error rate, availability).

    10. Security & Networking:

    Isolate resources using VPCs with proper subnetting, security groups, and NACLs.

    Use AWS WAF & CloudArmor for DDoS protection.

    Implement IAM roles/policies for least privilege access.

---

2. Describe a time when you improved the reliability or availability of a system. What metrics did you use to measure the improvement?

Ans: In my current SRE role, we had recurring issues during deployments — especially around downtime, slow rollback, and unclear visibility into failures. These were affecting our uptime and increasing operational overhead during on-call.

    Actions I Took:

    Improved Deployment Strategy:
    I worked on optimizing our deployment pipelines in Jenkins, introducing parallel test stages and automated validation scripts using Python. This reduced the manual checks that previously caused delays and downtime.

    Hardened GCP Cloud Armor Rules:
    I fine-tuned Cloud Armor policies to reduce attack surface and block unwanted traffic spikes that occasionally led to service degradation.

    Automated Vulnerability Reports:
    Created a mechanism to automatically generate and send weekly vulnerability summaries, reducing manual effort and enabling proactive patching.

    Monitored Infra More Proactively:
    Integrated better alerting on GCP and AWS resources using Cloud Monitoring and internal scripts, so we caught issues before they caused downtime.

    Metrics Used to Measure Improvement:

    Uptime: Improved service uptime from ~99.0% to 99.96% by reducing deployment-related failures.

    Deployment Time: Reduced rollout time by ~30% by automating validations and cleanups.

    MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): Cut MTTR during incidents by 40% by improving monitoring and documentation.

    On-Call Alerts: Reduced noisy alerts by improving thresholds and grouping, which made on-call weeks much more manageable.

---

3. How do you approach capacity planning for a rapidly growing application? What factors would you consider?

Ans: For a rapidly growing app like Goldcast, here’s how I’d approach capacity planning:

   1. Understand Workload Patterns:
   Analyze historical metrics (CPU, memory, request rate, DB queries) using Prometheus/New Relic.

   Identify peak traffic times (e.g., live events, webinars).

   2. Use Real Usage Data:
   Track growth rate in daily active users, sessions, and event sizes.

   Review API usage, concurrent connections, and DB transactions.

   3. Break It Down by Layer:
   Application Layer:

   Scale ECS tasks or pods based on HPA or load balancer metrics.

   Database Layer:

   Monitor query load, connection counts.

   Use read replicas, partitioning, or sharding when needed.

   Caching Layer:

   Plan for Redis/Elasticache growth based on hit rate & evictions.

   Storage & Logs:

   Account for S3 log growth, backups, retention policies.

   4. Infrastructure Strategy:
   Use IaC (Terraform) to model and replicate scaling infra.

   Apply Auto Scaling on EC2/ECS/Fargate based on usage.

   Keep buffer for unexpected spikes (~20–30%).

   5. Plan for Cost & Resilience:
   Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances where usage is predictable.

   Distribute across multi-AZ and have failover DBs ready.

   6. Continuous Re-Evaluation:
   Reassess every sprint or release cycle.

   Do load tests before major feature launches.

   TL;DR: I’d base planning on real usage data, traffic forecasts, infra metrics, and growth patterns — balancing performance, reliability, and cost.

   7. Explain the concept of "error budgets" in SRE practice and how you would implement them.

   Ans: What is an Error Budget?
   An error budget is the acceptable amount of failure for a system within a given period, based on its SLA/SLO.

   Formula:
   Error Budget = 100% - SLO
   So, if your SLO is 99.9% uptime, your error budget is 0.1% downtime per month (~43 minutes).

   Why It's Useful:
   Helps balance reliability vs. velocity.

   Enables teams to make informed trade-offs — e.g., ship fast or slow down to fix reliability.

   Prevents over-engineering "perfect" uptime.

   How I’d Implement It:
   Define SLOs with Stakeholders:

   For example, "99.95% successful event stream delivery within 2 seconds latency."

   Track SLI Metrics:

   Use Prometheus or New Relic to track actual error rate, latency, availability, etc.

   Calculate and Monitor Error Budget:

   Implement a dashboard showing live error budget burn rate.

   Alert if error budget is being consumed too fast.

   Enforce Policies:

   If budget is within limits → okay to deploy.

   If error budget is nearly exhausted → pause feature rollouts and prioritize reliability work.

   Postmortems & Learnings:

   When budget is breached, do a blameless RCA and log it for future learnings.

   Example (from my experience):
   I helped define SLOs around API response times. Once we noticed budget burn increased due to a new release, we paused deployments for 2 days, optimized DB queries, and fixed a latency issue before resuming. It prevented major downtime.

---

5. How would you balance reliability with feature velocity in a fast-paced development environment?

Ans: 1. Define Clear SLOs & Error Budgets:
    Start by defining measurable SLOs (e.g., 99.9% uptime, P95 latency < 500ms).

    Use error budgets to guide decision-making — if we're within budget, we push features; if we're burning it fast, we pause and fix.

    2. Automate CI/CD with Safety Nets:
    I use GitHub Actions/Jenkins to enforce quality via automated tests, security checks, and canary deployments.

    This reduces friction while keeping things safe.

    3. Roll Out Features Gradually:
    Implement feature flags and blue-green or canary deployments, so we can test in production without full exposure.

    4. Observability First Approach:
    I prioritize good monitoring, tracing, and logging before a feature goes live — using tools like New Relic, Prometheus, and custom scripts.

    This makes it easier to catch and roll back bad releases fast.

    5. Blameless Culture + RCAs:
    Encourage fast feedback loops without fear.

    If something breaks, we do a blameless postmortem, learn, and harden systems for next time.

    Real-life Example:
    We once had to ship a major refactor that risked latency regression. I worked with devs to break it into small deployable chunks, added Redis-based caching, and monitored rollout step-by-step. This way, we maintained both velocity and reliability.

    Balance is all about having the right guardrails, not slowing devs down unnecessarily.

## Automation and Scripting

6. Describe a complex operational task you automated. What scripting language did you use and why?

Ans : Cherry-pick automation

---

7. How would you write a script to detect and restart failed services across multiple servers?

Ans: To handle this, I’d typically write a script or use a configuration management tool like Ansible depending on the scale. For a script-based approach, I’d:

    Maintain a list of servers and critical services to monitor.

    Use SSH to remotely check the status of services using systemctl is-active.

    If a service is not active, I’d log the incident and then restart the service using systemctl restart.

    Optionally, I’d include alerting via email or Slack webhook for visibility.

    Here’s a basic Bash snippet:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
    services=("nginx" "postgresql" "redis")

    for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    for service in "${services[@]}"; do
        status=$(ssh "$server" "systemctl is-active $service")
        if [ "$status" != "active" ]; then
        ssh "$server" "sudo systemctl restart $service"
        fi
    done
    done
    ```
    For a larger environment, I’d prefer using Ansible with a playbook that can check and restart services in parallel, with better logging and idempotency.

---

8. What are the key considerations when writing automation scripts that modify production systems?

ans:There are several critical factors to keep in mind:

    Idempotency – Scripts should be safe to run multiple times without unintended side effects.

    Safety and Validation – Always validate input, check preconditions, and ideally run in dry-run or staging mode first.

    Logging and Auditing – Maintain detailed logs of what the script did, especially any changes or failures.

    Error Handling – Gracefully handle failures with retries, alerts, and rollback if needed.

    Access Control – Run with the least privilege necessary, and protect credentials or secrets securely.

    Testing – Scripts should be well-tested in a staging environment that mirrors prod.

    Monitoring and Alerting – Integrate with monitoring systems so teams are aware of any issues post-change.

    Rate Limiting – Avoid flooding the system; use throttling or batching when touching multiple systems.

    Rollback Strategy – Always have a plan to revert changes if something goes wrong.

    Code Review and Version Control – Store scripts in Git and review them like application code.

---

9.  How would you approach building a tool that automates the provisioning of a complete application stack on AWS?

Ans: I’d approach this in a modular and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) way. Here’s the high-level process:

    Define Requirements
    Understand the full stack: VPC, subnets, EC2, RDS, S3, Load Balancer, IAM roles, security groups, etc.

    Choose the Right Tools
    I’d use Terraform for IaC, possibly Packer for AMIs, and a configuration tool like Ansible or user-data scripts for post-provisioning setup.

    Design Modular Infrastructure
    Break it into reusable modules (network, compute, database, etc.) for flexibility and reusability.

    Parameterization
    Use variables and environment-based configurations (e.g., dev, staging, prod) for consistency.

    State Management
    Use remote state (like S3 + DynamoDB for Terraform) to safely manage infrastructure states across teams.

    Security and Secrets
    Use IAM roles with least privilege, store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

    Automation Pipeline
    Integrate with CI/CD tools (like GitHub Actions or Jenkins) to run provisioning as part of a pipeline.

    Testing & Validation
    Use tools like Terratest or kitchen-terraform to validate infrastructure before going live.

    Documentation & Rollback
    Document how it works and ensure there's a way to teardown or roll back if needed.


10. Explain the difference between imperative and declarative approaches in automation. Which do you prefer and why?

Ans: In automation:

    Imperative approach is about how to do things. You write step-by-step commands. E.g., in Bash or Python: install package, start service, etc.

    Declarative approach defines what the desired state should be. The tool figures out how to reach that state. E.g., with Terraform or Ansible’s YAML: "this package should be installed."

    Example:
    Imperative:

    ```bash
    apt update  
    apt install nginx  
    systemctl start nginx  
    ```

    Declarative (Ansible):

    ```yaml
    - name: Install and start nginx  
    apt: name=nginx state=present  
    service: name=nginx state=started  
    ```

    My preference:
    I prefer the declarative approach, especially for infrastructure, because:

    It's idempotent by default

    Easier to maintain and understand

    Better suited for version control and CI/CD

    Tools like Terraform and Ansible manage state and drift well

    But I still use imperative scripts for quick tasks or complex logic where step-by-step control is needed.

## AWS and Cloud Infrastructure

11. How would you optimize the cost of AWS resources while maintaining required performance and reliability?

Ans: I’d take a multi-layered approach:

Right-sizing resources
Use CloudWatch metrics and tools like AWS Compute Optimizer to downsize over-provisioned EC2, RDS, or EBS.

Use Auto Scaling
Implement auto scaling groups to scale based on demand instead of running resources 24/7.

Leverage Spot Instances and Savings Plans
Use Spot for non-critical workloads and commit to Savings/Reserved Instances for steady usage.

Use Serverless where possible
Move to Lambda, DynamoDB, or Fargate to avoid paying for idle time.

S3 & Storage Optimization
Use S3 lifecycle policies to move data to cheaper tiers like Glacier. Compress logs and use Intelligent-Tiering.

Eliminate Unused Resources
Regularly audit for unattached EBS volumes, idle load balancers, unused Elastic IPs, etc.

Monitoring and Alerting
Set budgets, CloudWatch alerts, and Cost Anomaly Detection to track spikes early.

Use Multi-AZ and Multi-Region only where needed
Avoid over-engineering HA unless it's required.

Conclusion:
It’s about finding the balance—using performance profiles to adjust resources smartly, automate scaling, and continuously monitor usage.

---

12. Describe your experience with AWS ECS. How would you design a scalable container orchestration system?

Ans: I’ve worked with AWS ECS (both EC2 and Fargate launch types) to deploy containerized microservices in production. My experience includes:

Creating task definitions and services

Integrating with ALB for traffic routing

Using CloudWatch logs and metrics for monitoring

Handling blue/green deployments via CodeDeploy or ECS Deployment Controller

Securing workloads with IAM roles for tasks and VPC integration

For a scalable design, I'd do the following:

Use Fargate for serverless scaling
Avoids EC2 maintenance and scales based on task count.

ALB with path-based routing
Route traffic to different services or versions easily.

Auto Scaling
Use ECS Service Auto Scaling based on CPU/memory or custom CloudWatch metrics.

Store config/secrets in SSM or Secrets Manager
Avoid hardcoding sensitive data.

CI/CD Integration
Automate builds and deployments with CodePipeline + CodeBuild or GitHub Actions.

Logging and Monitoring
Send logs to CloudWatch and integrate with X-Ray or Prometheus/Grafana stack.

Use Service Discovery
Enable ECS service discovery via Route 53 for internal communication.

Multi-AZ setup
Run tasks across multiple subnets in different AZs for HA.

Optional: For more complex needs, I'd consider EKS, but ECS is great for simpler use cases with tight AWS integration.

---

13. What strategies would you use to manage database performance and scaling in RDS?

Ans: To manage and scale RDS effectively, I’d focus on the following strategies:

Right Instance Type & Storage
Choose the optimal instance class (e.g., db.m6g, db.r6i) and use Provisioned IOPS if I/O is a bottleneck.

Read Replicas
Use read replicas to offload read-heavy traffic and support horizontal scaling.

Auto Scaling Storage
Enable storage autoscaling to grow disk without downtime.

Connection Pooling
Use tools like PgBouncer or RDS Proxy to manage DB connections efficiently.

Performance Insights & CloudWatch
Monitor query performance, latency, and resource usage regularly to spot bottlenecks.

Index Optimization & Query Tuning
Regularly analyze slow queries and use proper indexing strategies.

Multi-AZ for HA
Enable Multi-AZ deployments to ensure failover and better reliability.

Scheduled Maintenance & Backups
Automate backups and perform maintenance during off-peak hours.

Database Caching
Use ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) to cache frequent queries and reduce DB load.

Partitioning and Archiving
Archive cold data and partition large tables to improve performance.

---

14. How would you implement a secure and efficient caching layer using Elasticache?

Ans: To implement a secure and efficient caching layer with ElastiCache, I would follow these key steps:

1. Choosing the Right Engine
Redis: For more complex caching (e.g., pub/sub, sorted sets) and data persistence features.

Memcached: For simple, high-performance caching with no persistence.

2. Security Best Practices
VPC Integration: Deploy ElastiCache within a VPC to isolate it from external networks.

IAM Policies: Restrict access to ElastiCache nodes using IAM roles and policies.

Encryption: Enable encryption at rest and in transit for Redis to ensure sensitive data is protected.

Security Groups: Use restrictive security groups to only allow access from trusted EC2 instances or services.

ElastiCache Subnet Groups: Ensure proper subnet placement, with private subnets for nodes, to avoid direct internet access.

3. High Availability and Fault Tolerance
Multi-AZ Deployments: Use Multi-AZ for Redis clusters to ensure failover capabilities in case of node or region failure.

Replication: For Redis, use replica nodes for read scaling and automatic failover.

Backup and Restore: Enable automatic snapshots for Redis to periodically back up data.

4. Efficient Caching Patterns
Cache Aside: Only load data into the cache on demand (lazy loading). For example, when the application reads data that’s not in the cache, it pulls it from the database and stores it in the cache.

Time-to-Live (TTL): Set appropriate TTL values to ensure data is cached only as long as necessary and to avoid stale data.

Eviction Policy: Use LRU (Least Recently Used) or LFU (Least Frequently Used) eviction strategies for Redis to ensure that the cache doesn’t grow uncontrollably.

Data Segmentation: Cache high-traffic and read-heavy data (e.g., user profiles, product catalogs) while avoiding caching sensitive or frequently changing data.

5. Scaling ElastiCache
Sharding: For Redis, use Redis Cluster with sharding to distribute data across multiple nodes to handle larger datasets and traffic.

Auto Discovery: Enable auto discovery in client libraries (e.g., Redis clients) for seamless failover and scaling.

6. Monitoring and Alerts
CloudWatch Metrics: Monitor key metrics like CPU utilization, Memory usage, Cache hit/miss ratio, and Evictions.

Alarms: Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify if resources are nearing limits or cache performance is degrading.

ElastiCache Events: Track events for failovers, backups, and scaling operations.

7. Cost Efficiency
Scaling: Use Auto Scaling for read replicas to adjust based on demand.

Optimal Instance Type: Choose the right instance types (e.g., cache.m5.large) based on your workload's memory and CPU needs.

Data Expiry: Implement TTL and eviction policies to avoid unnecessary memory consumption and keep costs low.

This setup ensures that ElastiCache is both secure and efficient, scaling with application demand while protecting sensitive data.

---

15. Describe how you would set up a multi-region failover strategy for an AWS-hosted application.

Ans: Setting up a multi-region failover strategy ensures high availability and disaster recovery in case of a region failure. Here’s how I would approach it:

1. Infrastructure Deployment
Replicate Infrastructure in Multiple Regions:
Deploy the application stack in at least two geographically separate AWS regions (e.g., US-East-1 and US-West-2). This includes:

EC2 instances (or ECS/Fargate)

RDS instances (or DynamoDB)

S3 buckets (with cross-region replication)

VPCs, subnets, and security groups in both regions.

VPC Peering / Transit Gateway:
Set up VPC peering or a Transit Gateway between regions for communication between services, if needed.

2. Data Synchronization & Replication
Amazon RDS Multi-Region Setup:

Use Cross-Region Read Replicas or Aurora Global Databases for databases to keep data consistent across regions.

For non-relational databases (e.g., DynamoDB), enable global tables to replicate data in multiple regions.

S3 Cross-Region Replication:
Set up cross-region replication for S3 buckets to ensure that objects are replicated to the backup region.

3. Traffic Routing and DNS Failover
Route 53 for DNS Management:
Use Amazon Route 53 for DNS failover and routing.

Set up Route 53 latency-based routing to route traffic to the region with the lowest latency.

Implement Route 53 health checks to monitor the health of each region and trigger failover to the secondary region if the primary region fails.

Global Accelerator:
For performance optimization, use AWS Global Accelerator to automatically route traffic to the healthiest endpoint, ensuring minimal downtime during failover.

4. Load Balancing
Elastic Load Balancers (ELB):
Set up ELB in each region to distribute traffic across EC2 instances or containers.

Cross-region load balancing: Use Global Accelerator or Route 53 to manage which region’s load balancer receives traffic based on availability.

5. Health Checks and Monitoring
CloudWatch Monitoring:
Monitor the health of resources across regions using Amazon CloudWatch. Set up alarms for critical metrics like EC2 instance health, RDS replication lag, and S3 replication status.

Automated Recovery:
Use AWS Lambda or Step Functions to automate recovery processes, such as bringing up backup instances or initiating a failover procedure.

6. Failover Mechanisms
Automatic Failover:
For managed services like RDS (with Multi-AZ) or Aurora (Global Databases), failover is automatic.

Manual Failover for EC2:
For EC2-based setups, failover might require spinning up EC2 instances in the secondary region. Using Auto Scaling groups and infrastructure-as-code tools like CloudFormation or Terraform makes this process more automated.

7. Application State and Session Management
Distributed Session Storage:
Use Amazon ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached) for session management to store user sessions in-memory, allowing them to be shared across regions.

Stateless Application Design:
Ensure the application is stateless, or use shared services (e.g., S3 for file storage, DynamoDB for key-value data) for easy failover without losing session information.

8. Testing and DR Drills
Regular Failover Testing:
Set up disaster recovery drills to simulate region failures and ensure your failover mechanisms work as expected.

Chaos Engineering:
Use AWS Fault Injection Simulator or other chaos engineering tools to test resilience and identify weak points in the failover process.

9. Cost Considerations
Cost Efficiency:
Avoid over-provisioning in the secondary region by leveraging Auto Scaling and spot instances for non-critical workloads.

Use Amazon S3 Glacier for storing backups and snapshots at a lower cost in the secondary region.

Conclusion: By deploying a multi-region infrastructure with automatic failover, data replication, and active health checks, the application remains highly available and resilient against region-wide failures, minimizing downtime.


## Infrastructure as Code

### **Q: Compare and contrast Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible. When would you choose one over the others?**

**A:**  
- **Terraform**:  
  - **Declarative** IaC tool.
  - Works across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
  - **Stateful** – Tracks infrastructure state and uses it to determine changes.
  - **Good for**: Multi-cloud or hybrid environments, provisioning and managing infrastructure, consistent and repeatable deployments.
  
- **CloudFormation**:  
  - **AWS-specific** declarative IaC tool.
  - Managed and deeply integrated with AWS.
  - **Stateful** – Tracks stack state internally, but requires AWS-specific knowledge.
  - **Good for**: Fully integrated AWS environments, deep integration with AWS services, managing AWS resources with native tooling.

- **Ansible**:  
  - **Imperative** IaC tool that also supports declarative configuration.
  - Agentless and works on any infrastructure that SSH supports (Linux, Windows).
  - Primarily used for **configuration management**, but can be used for provisioning.
  - **Good for**: Configuration management, application deployment, state-based configurations across multiple systems.

**When to choose:**
- **Terraform**: When working in a multi-cloud environment or looking for a tool that can handle the full lifecycle of infrastructure management.
- **CloudFormation**: If you're exclusively using AWS and need deep AWS integrations or are working within AWS-native tools.
- **Ansible**: When needing to configure servers, deploy software, and automate repetitive tasks (good for post-provisioning setup).

---

### **Q: How would you manage infrastructure changes in a team environment using Infrastructure as Code?**

**A:**  
- **Version Control**: Store all infrastructure code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, etc.) in **Git** or another version control system. This ensures that all changes are tracked and auditable.
- **Code Reviews**: Implement a **pull request** workflow to ensure changes are reviewed by the team before being merged into the main branch.
- **Branching Strategy**: Use a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or trunk-based development) to isolate work on features, fixes, and releases.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically validate and deploy changes. Use tools like **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **GitLab CI** to test infrastructure changes in non-prod environments before applying to production.
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments (dev, staging, production) using **workspaces** (Terraform), **stack sets** (CloudFormation), or different directories (Ansible). This prevents accidental changes to production environments.
- **Approval Workflow**: For sensitive changes, implement an **approval gate** in the CI/CD pipeline where team leads or senior engineers approve changes before deployment.

---

### **Q: What strategies do you use to test infrastructure code before applying changes to production?**

**A:**  
- **Unit Tests**:  
  - For **Terraform**, use **terraform plan** and **terraform validate** to check for syntax and logic errors. **Terratest** can be used to write unit tests for Terraform code, ensuring the infrastructure is created as expected.
  - For **CloudFormation**, use **cfn-lint** to validate templates against best practices.
  - For **Ansible**, use **molecule** to test playbooks against various configurations.
  
- **Plan and Dry Run**:  
  - Use the `terraform plan` or `cloudformation validate-template` commands to simulate changes without applying them.
  
- **Automated Integration Testing**:  
  - After infrastructure is provisioned in a test environment, use **integration tests** to verify if the infrastructure works as expected (e.g., app is deployed, database is reachable, etc.).
  
- **Test in Staging**:  
  Always deploy changes first to a **staging environment** that mirrors production, then validate through manual or automated tests before going to production.
  
- **Manual Review and Approval**:  
  Require manual approval in the CI/CD pipeline before changes are pushed to production to ensure any major changes are scrutinized.

---

### **Q: Describe how you would handle secrets and sensitive configuration in Infrastructure as Code.**

**A:**  
- **Environment Variables**:  
  Store sensitive data like API keys and credentials as environment variables that are not stored in the code repository.
  
- **Secrets Management Tools**:  
  - Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** for storing sensitive secrets and retrieve them during provisioning or at runtime.
  - For non-AWS environments, use **Vault by HashiCorp** or **Azure Key Vault** for securely storing and accessing secrets.
  
- **Encryption**:  
  Ensure that secrets are **encrypted** both at rest and in transit. Use built-in encryption capabilities of services like S3, RDS, and Elasticache, or encrypt values manually if storing them in infrastructure files.
  
- **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**:  
  Never hardcode secrets directly in your code, especially in version-controlled files. Always use external secret management tools.
  
- **Access Control**:  
  Implement strict **IAM policies** and role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to secrets. Ensure that only the required services or team members have access to them.

---

### **Q: How would you implement a blue-green deployment strategy using Infrastructure as Code tools?**

**A:**  
To implement a **blue-green deployment** with IaC, I would use the following steps:

1. **Define Two Identical Environments (Blue and Green)**:  
   Create two completely separate environments (Blue and Green) in your infrastructure, typically using separate **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)** and **Auto Scaling Groups** (ASG) for each.

2. **Use Infrastructure as Code**:  
   - **Terraform/CloudFormation**: Define both environments (Blue and Green) using IaC. This could be in separate modules or stacks for isolation. 
   - Use **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **ECS**, or **EKS** for managing the applications, ensuring each environment is set up identically except for traffic routing.
   
3. **Switch Traffic Between Blue and Green**:  
   - Initially, route all traffic to the **Blue environment**.
   - Once the **Green environment** is fully deployed and tested, switch the traffic by modifying the **Route 53 DNS records** or updating the **ELB target groups**.
   
4. **Rollback Mechanism**:  
   - In case of failure in the Green environment, you can simply **switch traffic back to Blue**. This rollback is quick and doesn’t require manual intervention since the infrastructure is defined as code.
   
5. **Automate the Process**:  
   - Integrate this process into your CI/CD pipeline where each deployment involves updating either the Blue or Green environment, running tests, and switching traffic.

6. **Cleanup**:  
   - Once the Green environment is stable and verified, clean up or decommission the Blue environment to save costs, or keep it as a backup for the next deployment.


## Monitoring and Debugging

### **Q: Describe your approach to setting up monitoring for a new service. What key metrics would you track?**

**A:**  
To set up monitoring for a new service, I would take the following steps:

1. **Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:  
   First, I’d identify the core business functions of the service and set up **KPIs** based on its objectives (e.g., request latency, throughput, error rates).

2. **Set Up Metrics Collection**:
   - Use **Prometheus** or **CloudWatch** to collect relevant metrics.
   - Track the following key metrics:
     - **System metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O.
     - **Application-level metrics**: Request rate (e.g., requests per second), response time, error rates, and success rates.
     - **Database metrics**: Query execution time, connection count, replication lag (if applicable).
     - **Custom metrics**: Business-related metrics such as user sign-ups, orders processed, or transactions completed.
  
3. **Log Aggregation**:  
   Integrate with **CloudWatch Logs**, **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or **Datadog** for log aggregation and analysis.

4. **Service Dependencies**:  
   Track the health of service dependencies (e.g., third-party APIs, databases) with appropriate metrics such as availability, response time, and error rates.

5. **Alerting Setup**:  
   Create **alerting thresholds** for critical KPIs, using tools like **CloudWatch Alarms** or **Prometheus Alertmanager**, to notify you of anomalies.

6. **Dashboard**:  
   Set up **visualizations** (e.g., Grafana) for real-time insights and trend analysis on key metrics, so the team can monitor the health of the service proactively.

### **Q: How would you debug a performance issue in a distributed system? Walk through your methodology.**

**A:**  
When debugging a performance issue in a distributed system, I would follow this approach:

1. **Reproduce the Issue**:  
   Attempt to reproduce the issue in a **staging environment** using similar traffic patterns, load, and conditions. This helps isolate the problem and avoid further complications in production.

2. **Check for Immediate Red Flags**:  
   - Use **metrics** (CPU, memory, disk usage) and **logs** to check for sudden spikes or anomalies in system performance.
   - Look for **error rates** or **timeouts** in logs, especially from downstream services, which might be causing bottlenecks.

3. **Isolate the Affected Layer**:  
   - **Application layer**: Check for slow queries, inefficient code, or memory leaks.
   - **Network layer**: Look for issues in network latency, packet loss, or bandwidth bottlenecks.
   - **Database layer**: Analyze query performance, locking issues, or resource saturation.
   - **External services**: Investigate if third-party APIs or services are causing delays.

4. **Use Distributed Tracing**:  
   Tools like **Jaeger** or **Zipkin** can provide insights into the request flow across services and pinpoint where delays or errors occur.

5. **Check Historical Data**:  
   Look at **historical performance metrics** to identify trends or incidents leading up to the performance degradation, which might help to pinpoint when the issue started.

6. **Hypothesis and Testing**:  
   After gathering enough data, formulate hypotheses about the root cause (e.g., high database load, network bottleneck) and test them one by one. You can apply changes in a controlled manner to validate fixes.

7. **Perform Load Testing**:  
   Once identified, simulate load again on the affected system to see if the fix resolves the issue under normal and high load conditions.

---

### **Q: How would you implement alerting that minimizes false positives while ensuring critical issues are caught?**

**A:**  
To minimize false positives and ensure critical issues are caught, I would focus on the following strategies:

1. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**:  
   - Avoid setting too **sensitive thresholds** for metrics like response time or CPU usage, as these might cause unnecessary alerts.
   - Implement **dynamic thresholds** that take into account **normal fluctuations** (e.g., based on historical averages or a rolling window).

2. **Use Anomaly Detection**:  
   Leverage **machine learning** or advanced anomaly detection algorithms that detect unusual patterns in metric behavior (e.g., CloudWatch Anomaly Detection).

3. **Alert Severity Levels**:  
   Categorize alerts by severity (e.g., **critical**, **warning**, **info**). Only trigger **critical** alerts for issues that affect service availability or user experience.

4. **Multimetric Alerting**:  
   Avoid relying on single metrics for alerting. Combine metrics (e.g., high response time + increased error rates) to improve the accuracy of alerts.

5. **Rate-Limiting and Throttling**:  
   Implement rate-limiting for alerts to avoid alert storms. For example, only send one alert per minute for the same issue until it’s resolved.

6. **Silencing and Maintenance Windows**:  
   Set up **maintenance windows** to silence alerts during planned downtimes or deployments, reducing false alerts during these periods.

7. **Escalation Process**:  
   Create an **escalation policy** where less critical issues are first handled by lower-priority teams or automated processes before being escalated.

### **Q: Explain how you would use New Relic and Prometheus together in a monitoring setup. What are the strengths of each?**

**A:**  
**New Relic** and **Prometheus** can be used together to provide a robust and comprehensive monitoring setup.

- **Prometheus**:  
  - **Strengths**: Open-source, **powerful metric collection**, and querying. It excels in collecting time-series metrics from a variety of sources (services, applications, databases, etc.). It's very **scalable** and integrates easily with **Grafana** for visualization.
  - **Usage**: Use **Prometheus** for **custom metrics collection** and **detailed time-series data** for your application infrastructure and services.
  
- **New Relic**:  
  - **Strengths**: Offers **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**, **real-time data collection**, and end-to-end tracing for performance optimization. It provides rich **visualization** and analysis dashboards for system and application performance.
  - **Usage**: Use **New Relic** for deep application-level performance insights, **distributed tracing**, and **error tracking**. It also provides infrastructure monitoring but with more application-centric data.

**Integration**:
   - **Prometheus for Metrics**: Use **Prometheus** to collect raw metrics like CPU usage, memory, and request rates.
   - **New Relic for APM**: Use **New Relic** to trace performance bottlenecks in your application, such as slow queries, latency, or database interactions.
   - **Unified Dashboards**: Integrate **Prometheus metrics** with **New Relic** dashboards for a more holistic view of your system’s health.

### **Q: Describe a challenging production issue you've debugged. How did you identify the root cause?**

**A:**  
One of the most challenging production issues I debugged involved an **intermittent latency spike** in a high-traffic application that caused **timeouts** for end-users.

1. **Initial Symptoms**:  
   Users started experiencing timeouts randomly, but it wasn’t consistent. Load testing didn’t reproduce the issue, and the logs were only showing brief spikes in response times.

2. **Step 1 - Monitoring**:  
   I reviewed **CloudWatch metrics**, which showed CPU spikes on a particular EC2 instance when the issue occurred, but not consistently. This led me to suspect a resource contention issue.

3. **Step 2 - Distributed Tracing**:  
   I enabled **X-Ray** to trace requests across services. This helped me isolate the problem to a specific service that was being bottlenecked by **database locks** during peak load.

4. **Step 3 - Database Performance**:  
   I checked **RDS performance metrics** and identified that one of the database queries had a high **execution time** during peak hours, causing the rest of the system to back up.

5. **Step 4 - Resolution**:  
   I optimized the query and added proper indexing. I also adjusted the **read replicas** to offload some of the read traffic, and implemented a **circuit breaker** pattern to reduce load during times of high contention.

6. **Step 5 - Post-mortem**:  
   After the fix, I ran load tests again and monitored real-time traffic to ensure stability. I also created **detailed dashboards** and **alerts** to monitor for similar issues in the future.


## CI/CD and Deployment

### **Q: How would you design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices architecture?**

**A:**  
A CI/CD pipeline for a **microservices architecture** should be designed to handle multiple independent services with their own life cycles, dependencies, and deployment patterns. Here’s how I would design it:

1. **Source Code Management**:  
   - Use **Git** for version control, with separate repositories for each microservice (or a monorepo, depending on the team's preference).
   - Integrate **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket** with the pipeline.

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Each microservice should have its own **build pipeline**. This includes:
     - **Code linting** and **static analysis** (e.g., ESLint for Node.js, SonarQube).
     - **Unit tests** and **integration tests**.
     - **Building docker images** for each microservice.
     - **Container scanning** for vulnerabilities (e.g., using tools like **Trivy** or **Clair**).
     - If dependencies exist between microservices, use **versioning** and ensure the right dependencies are tested in isolation and integration.

3. **Continuous Delivery**:
   - Once the service is built and tested, the next step would be to deploy to a **staging environment**. This can be done using Kubernetes or ECS, where each microservice is deployed independently.
   - Use **Helm** charts or **Terraform** to manage the deployment of infrastructure.

4. **Service Dependencies**:
   - **Service discovery** and **API Gateway**: Ensure that services can discover and communicate with each other using tools like **Consul** or a service mesh (e.g., **Istio**).
   - **Inter-service integration testing**: Create end-to-end tests that simulate interactions between services to ensure they work well together.

5. **Deployment Strategies**:
   - Use strategies like **blue-green**, **canary**, or **rolling deployments** for safer deployments, as each service should be independently deployable.
   - For **canary deployments**, only a small subset of traffic should be routed to the new version while monitoring for errors.

6. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Integrate tools like **Prometheus** or **Datadog** for **metrics** and **Grafana** for visualization.
   - Use **ELK stack** or **Splunk** for **log aggregation** and **distributed tracing** with **Jaeger** or **Zipkin** for debugging.

7. **Automation and CI/CD Tools**:
   - Use **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, or **GitHub Actions** for orchestrating the entire pipeline. These tools can be configured to trigger builds on code changes, test phases, and deploy to different environments.

---

### **Q: What strategies do you use to ensure that deployments are safe and minimize user impact?**

**A:**  
To ensure safe deployments with minimal user impact, I use the following strategies:

1. **Blue-Green Deployments**:  
   - Deploy new versions to the **green** environment while the **blue** environment remains active. Once the green environment is validated, switch the traffic to it.
   
2. **Canary Deployments**:  
   - Gradually roll out new changes to a small subset of users or traffic, monitor the impact, and then expand the rollout. This helps catch issues early and reduces the overall impact.

3. **Rolling Updates**:  
   - For microservices in containers or Kubernetes, use **rolling updates** to deploy one instance at a time, ensuring that the service remains available throughout the process.

4. **Health Checks and Automated Rollback**:  
   - Implement **health checks** at the application and infrastructure level to verify service functionality during and after deployment.
   - Implement an **automated rollback** mechanism in case of failures, where traffic is automatically routed back to the previous stable version.

5. **Feature Toggles**:  
   - Use **feature flags** to deploy new features in an off state. This allows for deploying code without immediately exposing new features to users. Features can be enabled/disabled dynamically without redeploying.

6. **Testing in Staging/Pre-Prod**:  
   - Before pushing to production, validate changes in a staging or pre-prod environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.

7. **Monitoring and Alerts**:  
   - Ensure monitoring is in place (e.g., **Prometheus**, **New Relic**, or **Datadog**) to quickly detect and alert on any issues during the deployment. 

8. **Traffic Shaping**:  
   - Use tools like **Istio** or **AWS API Gateway** to implement advanced traffic routing during deployments, like shifting a small percentage of traffic to a new version of the service.

---

### **Q: How would you implement canary deployments using GitHub Actions?**

**A:**  
To implement **canary deployments** using **GitHub Actions**, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Define the GitHub Action Workflow**:
   - Create a GitHub Action workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that is triggered on specific events, such as a `push` to the `main` branch or a **tag** creation.
   
2. **Build and Deploy the Service**:
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate the **build** and **push** of your Docker image to a container registry (e.g., **Amazon ECR**, **DockerHub**).
   
3. **Deploy to Canary**:
   - For Kubernetes, use **kubectl** or **Helm** to deploy the new version to a **canary deployment**. Limit the number of replicas or pods for the canary service (e.g., 10% of the total pods).

   Example in GitHub Actions:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         
         - name: Set up Docker
           uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
         
         - name: Build and Push Docker image
           run: |
             docker build -t ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
             docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
         
         - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
           run: |
             kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }} --record
   ```

4. **Routing Traffic to Canary**:
   - Use a **service mesh** like **Istio** or **NGINX** to gradually route traffic from the production environment to the canary deployment. Alternatively, with Kubernetes, you can adjust the **replica counts** or use **Istio virtual services** for canary traffic routing.

5. **Monitor Canary Deployment**:
   - Monitor logs, metrics, and health checks for the canary version. If issues arise, roll back quickly.

6. **Promote to Production**:
   - If the canary version is stable, incrementally increase the traffic directed to it until it fully replaces the previous version.

---

### **Q: Describe how you would set up an automated rollback mechanism in your deployment pipeline.**

**A:**  
To set up an **automated rollback** mechanism:

1. **Health Checks**:  
   - Ensure that services expose health endpoints (`/health` or `/readiness`) and that they are continuously monitored. If the health check fails after deployment, an automated rollback should be triggered.

2. **Define Rollback Logic in CI/CD**:
   - For tools like **GitLab CI** or **GitHub Actions**, set up rollback steps in your pipeline that automatically trigger if deployment steps fail.
   - Use tools like **Argo Rollouts** or **Kubernetes**'s `kubectl rollout undo` to revert deployments.

   Example rollback step:
   ```yaml
   - name: Rollback Deployment on Failure
     if: failure()
     run: |
       kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs and Metrics**:
   - Set up monitoring (e.g., **Prometheus** or **Datadog**) to check for significant errors after deployment (e.g., high error rates or low availability). If thresholds are breached, trigger a rollback.

4. **Canary and Blue-Green Strategies**:
   - If using **canary deployments**, configure the rollback to reroute traffic back to the previous version if the new version fails.
   - With **blue-green** deployments, roll back to the blue environment if the green environment fails.

---

### **Q: How do you approach testing in a CI/CD pipeline? What types of tests would you include?**

**A:**  
In a CI/CD pipeline, I ensure that the following types of tests are automated and run at different stages:

1. **Unit Tests**:  
   - These are the first line of defense to ensure the basic functionality of individual components. Use frameworks like **JUnit** (Java), **Mocha** (JavaScript), or **pytest** (Python).

2. **Integration Tests**:  
   - These tests verify that different components of the system work together as expected. For example, testing interactions between services or checking database connections.

3. **Static Code Analysis**:  
   - Run **linting** and **static analysis** to enforce coding standards and catch errors early (e.g., using **ESLint**, **SonarQube**).

4. **UI/End-to-End Tests**:  
   - These tests simulate user interactions to ensure that the application behaves correctly. Use tools like **Selenium**, **Cypress**, or **TestCafe**.

5. **Performance Tests**:  
   - Run **load tests** and **stress tests** to verify that the system can handle the expected load (e.g., using **JMeter**, **Gatling**, or **Locust**).

6. **Security Tests**:  
   - Automate **security scanning** tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Snyk** to detect vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies.

7. **Acceptance Tests**:  
   - Use **Cucumber** or **Postman** to run acceptance tests that confirm the system meets business requirements.

8. **Smoke Tests**:  
   - Run basic tests post-deployment to ensure the application is functional before further testing.

9. **Test in Staging**:  
   - Before deploying to production, run all tests in a **staging environment** that mirrors production as closely as possible.

2. **Patching**:  
   - Keep system and packages updated (`unattended-upgrades`, cron jobs).

3. **Firewall & Ports**:  
   - Configure **iptables** or **ufw** to allow only necessary ports.

4. **Intrusion Detection**:  
   - Tools like **fail2ban**, **AIDE**, or **OSSEC** to monitor and block malicious activity.

5. **Audit & Logging**:  
   - Enable **auditd**, log rotation, and remote logging.

6. **Filesystem Hardening**:  
   - Mount `/tmp`, `/var` with `noexec`, `nosuid`.

---

### **34. How would you diagnose and resolve a network connectivity issue between two services?**

**A:**  
1. **Ping & DNS**:  
   Start with `ping` or `dig/nslookup` to confirm DNS resolution and basic connectivity.

2. **Port Reachability**:  
   Use `telnet`, `nc`, or `curl` to check if the target port is reachable.

3. **Firewall Rules**:  
   Check **iptables**, **security groups**, or **NACLs** (on AWS).

4. **Service Logs**:  
   Review both client and server logs for timeouts or errors.

5. **Traceroute & Packet Capture**:  
   Use `traceroute` or `tcpdump` to see where packets are getting dropped.

6. **Fix**:  
   Update routes, fix misconfigurations, restart services if needed.

---

### **35. How would you implement proper logging across a distributed Linux environment?**

**A:**  
1. **Centralized Logging**:  
   Use tools like **ELK Stack**, **Fluentd**, or **Graylog** to aggregate logs.

2. **Agent Installation**:  
   Install log shippers (e.g., **Filebeat**, **Fluent Bit**) on all nodes.

3. **Structured Logs**:  
   Use JSON or key-value format to ensure logs are parsable.

4. **Tagging & Indexing**:  
   Tag logs with service name, hostname, environment (prod/staging), and timestamps.

5. **Log Rotation**:  
   Configure `logrotate` to manage disk space efficiently.

6. **Alerting & Retention**:  
   Set up alerts on error patterns and define retention policies to manage storage.


## Databases

### **36. How would you approach optimizing query performance in PostgreSQL?**

**A:**  
1. **Use `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)`** to understand query execution plans.  
2. **Add indexes** on frequently filtered or joined columns.  
3. **Avoid SELECT \***; fetch only needed columns.  
4. Optimize joins and use **CTEs or subqueries** carefully.  
5. Regularly **vacuum/analyze** tables.  
6. Use **connection pooling** (e.g., with PgBouncer).  
7. Monitor slow queries via `pg_stat_statements`.

---

### **37. Describe your experience with database replication and failover strategies.**

**A:**  
I’ve worked with **PostgreSQL streaming replication** (asynchronous and synchronous). For failover:  
- I use tools like **Patroni**, **repmgr**, or **Stolon** for auto-failover.  
- I always ensure **monitoring of replication lag** and setup **read replicas** for scaling reads.  
- In AWS, I leverage **RDS Multi-AZ** for automated failover and **Aurora replicas** when needed.

---

### **38. How would you monitor database performance and what key metrics would you track?**

**A:**  
I monitor using **CloudWatch**, **pg_stat_statements**, or **Prometheus + Postgres Exporter**. Key metrics include:  
- **Query latency** and **slow queries**  
- **Connections** and **connection pool usage**  
- **Cache hit ratio**  
- **Replication lag**  
- **Locks** and **deadlocks**  
- **Disk I/O**, **CPU**, and **memory usage**  

---

### **39. Explain how you would design a database backup and recovery strategy.**

**A:**  
1. Use **daily full backups** (e.g., `pg_basebackup`) and **continuous WAL archiving** for PITR.  
2. Automate and schedule backups using cron or AWS Backup (for RDS).  
3. Encrypt and store backups securely (S3 + lifecycle policies).  
4. Test **restore procedures regularly** — both full and PITR.  
5. Maintain backup retention based on RTO/RPO requirements.

---

### **40. How would you approach database schema changes in a high-availability environment?**

**A:**  
1. **Use migrations tools** like Flyway or Liquibase with version control.  
2. Apply **non-blocking changes** (e.g., add columns with defaults later).  
3. **Deploy in phases**: write old + new code together → switch → remove old schema.  
4. Test changes in staging with production-like traffic.  
5. Monitor replication lag post-change.  
6. Always have a **rollback script** ready in case of issues.


## Problem-Solving and Communication

### **Describe a time when you had to make a difficult technical decision. How did you approach it?**

**A:**  
I had to decide between optimizing a legacy system or migrating to Kubernetes. I weighed cost, downtime risk, and team familiarity. I ran a POC, got team feedback, and chose migration with phased rollout — it improved scalability without major disruptions.

---

### **How do you stay updated with the latest technologies and practices in the SRE field?**

**A:**  
I follow blogs (Google SRE, Netflix Tech), read RFCs, attend webinars, and engage on Reddit, Hacker News, and GitHub. I also test tools in personal labs and watch KubeCon, AWS re:Invent talks.

---

### **How would you explain a complex technical issue to non-technical stakeholders?**

**A:**  
I focus on **impact**, **root cause**, and **next steps**, avoiding jargon. For example: *“A backend delay increased page load time. We fixed it and added monitoring to prevent recurrence.”* Clear, concise, and tied to business impact.

---

### **Describe how you would handle an incident during off-hours. What would be your priorities?**

**A:**  
1. Acknowledge the alert and validate severity.  
2. Stabilize the system — rollback, scale, or patch.  
3. Communicate status to stakeholders.  
4. Document everything for postmortem.  
5. After resolution, sleep 😅 and follow up with RCA and fixes.

---

### **How do you approach documentation for systems and processes?**

**A:**  
I keep it **clear, concise, and living** — focused on “how” and “why.” Use markdown in repos or Confluence. Include runbooks, architecture diagrams, and decision logs. I regularly review docs during sprints or postmortems.

## Situational and Behavioral

### **46. Describe how you would handle a situation where multiple critical systems are failing simultaneously.**

**A:**  
Stay calm, assess impact, and triage.  
1. Prioritize based on user/business impact.  
2. Assign team members to separate issues if possible.  
3. Communicate early and regularly with stakeholders.  
4. Focus on mitigation first, root cause later.  
5. Log everything for post-incident review.

---

### **47. How do you prioritize tasks when dealing with both ongoing projects and operational issues?**

**A:**  
I use an **impact/urgency matrix**.  
- Urgent incidents take priority.  
- I timebox ops work and keep async updates for project work.  
- I align with stakeholders weekly to reprioritize.  
- Use tools like Jira to keep transparency across tasks.

---

### **48. Tell me about a time when you identified and fixed a potential reliability issue before it affected users.**

**A:**  
Noticed growing memory usage in a service via Prometheus before alerts fired.  
- Ran profiling, found a memory leak in a third-party library.  
- Rolled back the update, patched it in staging, and worked with the dev team to fix.  
- No user impact, and we added a new alert to catch similar patterns early.

---

### **49. How do you collaborate with development teams to improve system reliability?**

**A:**  
- I join sprint planning to flag potential risks early.  
- Use SLIs/SLOs to align on reliability goals.  
- Pair on observability and rollback plans during releases.  
- Hold blameless postmortems together to drive shared ownership.

---

### **50. Describe your approach to on-call rotations and responsibilities. How do you ensure a healthy work-life balance?**

**A:**  
- I prefer rotating on-call every week with clear handoffs and a buddy system.  
- Use good alert hygiene — only actionable alerts, nothing noisy.  
- After-hours incidents should be rare — if not, it's a system smell.  
- Take comp time after high-severity shifts and regularly review on-call load in retros.
